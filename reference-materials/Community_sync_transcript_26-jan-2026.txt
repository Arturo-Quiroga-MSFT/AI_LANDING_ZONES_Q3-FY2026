Meeting notes:
AI Center of Excellence Program Overview and Expansion: 
Jason, Andressa, Devanshi, Ana, and Lucy provided an in-depth overview of the AI Center of Excellence (CoE) program, its structure, current components, and the transition from version 1 to version 2, inviting team members to contribute to new workshops and initiatives.
	Program Structure and Goals: Jason explained that the AI Center of Excellence was established within the EPS organization to provide technical enablement through four main components: governance, business discovery, responsible AI, and Gen AI OPS. The program aims to empower partners to deliver AI transformation offers to customers, supporting a three-step process to bring AI workloads to production.
	Transition to Version 2 and Call for Contributions: The team announced the move from version 1 to version 2 of the CoE, emphasizing the need for broader team involvement in developing new workshops, particularly in areas such as landing zones, Gen AI OPS, and security. Jason invited interested team members to reach out to the responsible leads for each area to participate in building these assets.
	AI Transformation Offer and Partner Engagement: Jason described the AI transformation offer as a sales enablement activity delivered through partners, with a structured journey involving AI discovery, landing zones, and the Gen AI factory. The CoE provides technical enablement to ensure partners are ready to deliver these offers, with a focus on scaling production workloads and expanding market share in key verticals.
Gen AI OPS Accelerator and Hands-On Enablement: 
Ana and Jason discussed the development of a Gen AI OPS accelerator repository to provide partners with practical templates and best practices for managing generative AI lifecycle and implementation, seeking team collaboration for further development.
	Hands-On Labs and Practical Enablement: Ana highlighted the importance of hands-on labs in generative AI workshops, referencing a recent delivery in Peru where practical exercises helped partners translate technical concepts into actionable skills.
	Accelerator Repository Initiative: The team is building an accelerator repository containing practical templates for partners to use and adapt in their own projects, with a focus on implementing best practices using infrastructure as code and lifecycle management for generative AI operations.
AI Discovery Cards Workshops and Featured Partner Program: 
Lucy provided an overview of the AI Discovery Cards workshops, their role in partner enablement, and the introduction of the Featured Partner Program, encouraging the team to share success stories and nominate qualifying partners.
	Workshop Structure and Impact: Lucy explained that AI Discovery Cards workshops help partners identify and prioritize use cases aligned with business impact, supporting both virtual and in-person delivery, and facilitating one-to-many sessions where possible.
	Featured Partner Program Requirements: Lucy described the new Featured Partner Program, which recognizes partners who have delivered at least three AI Discovery Cards workshops (including internal and customer-facing sessions) and meet specialization criteria, with the goal of amplifying their impact through global channels.
	Story Sharing and Regional Best Practices: The team encouraged sharing of regional success stories and best practices, particularly from the Americas and Latam, to inform and inspire the broader community and contribute to ongoing program evolution.
AI Landing Zones and Reference Architectures: 
Jason detailed the AI Landing Zones initiative, outlining the need for standardized, production-ready reference architectures for generative AI workloads and inviting team members to participate in testing and developing these assets.
	Reference Architecture Overview: Jason described the AI Landing Zones as secure, resilient, and scalable reference architectures implemented via Bicep, Terraform, and portal templates, designed to support a variety of AI applications and use cases.
	Standardization and Testing: The team is seeking to standardize on the best architectural 'flavor' and encourages team members to test workflows and scripts to ensure production readiness, with the opportunity to contribute to the ground floor of version 2 development.
Responsible AI Maturity Model and Governance: 
Devanshi presented the Responsible AI Maturity Model Workshop, which helps partners assess and advance their responsible AI practices, and outlined available resources and support for navigating sensitive use cases and compliance requirements.
	Maturity Model Workshop Structure: The Responsible AI Maturity Model Workshop guides partners through assessing their current maturity across organizational foundations, team approach, and practice, using a structured set of dimensions and levels to identify areas for improvement.
	Governance Resources and Support: Devanshi and Christian serve as points of contact for responsible AI governance, offering support for impact assessments, navigating sensitive and restricted use cases, and consolidating relevant resources and best practices for partner engagements.
Integration of Apps, Devs, and AI Initiatives: 
Peter, Jason, and others discussed opportunities for collaboration between the apps, devs, and AI communities, focusing on applying an application development perspective to AI transformation efforts and leveraging tools like GitHub Copilot.
	Application Development Lens on AI Initiatives: Peter suggested integrating app and dev expertise into AI transformation projects, such as enhancing the Microsoft Agent Framework with Azure Durable Functions for improved scalability and reliability, and contributing to Azure Accelerate and intelligent apps specializations.
	GitHub Copilot and Partner Enablement: The team discussed the use of GitHub Copilot as a tool for partners to build and enhance their own products, with ongoing conversations about its role in rapid prototyping and integration with partner solutions.
Regional Adaptation and Partner Engagement Strategies: 
Andressa, Ben, Andre, and Jason explored regional differences in workshop delivery and partner engagement, addressing how programs like the AI Transformation Offer and Discovery Cards are tailored for SI and SDC partners and adapted for local contexts.
	SI and SDC Partner Engagement: Ben and Andre clarified that the AI Transformation Offer is primarily targeted at SI partners, but adaptations exist for SDCs, such as running workshops as if SDCs were customers to identify new AI opportunities in their solutions.
	Regional Leads and Customization: Jason noted that regional leads are in place for Discovery Cards and that future plans include expanding regional leadership across other program components to accommodate local differences in cloud environments and partner needs.
Technical Environment Access and Governance for AI Agents: 
Ben, Mike, and Peter discussed the availability of Azure subscriptions with advanced features for AI agent development, the process for provisioning environments with necessary licenses, and considerations for governance and cost management.
	Provisioning and Access to Agent 365: Ben explained that a new Azure subscription experience can be provisioned via the CDX portal, which includes M365 Copilot licenses and enables advanced agent identity features, with documentation available for the setup process.
	Governance and Cost Considerations: The team discussed the need for governance around subscription costs and the potential for each PSA to have their own environment, pending leadership approval and alignment with cost management strategies.
Upcoming Meeting on Logic Apps in AI Scenarios: 
Andressa announced that the next meeting will feature a product manager discussing Logic Apps in the context of AI apps and agent scenarios, inviting all interested team members to participate.
	Future Meeting Topic: The next scheduled call will focus on Logic Apps and their application in AI apps and agent scenarios, with an open invitation extended to the AI team and others interested in the topic.
