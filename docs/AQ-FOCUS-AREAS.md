## **AI Landing Zones Focus** (Your Primary Area) 29-Jan-2026

**What They Are:**
- Secure, resilient, and scalable reference architectures for Gen AI workloads
- Implemented via **Bicep, Terraform, and portal templates**
- Designed to support various AI applications and use cases
- Part of the **AI transformation offer** journey: AI discovery → Landing zones → Gen AI factory

**Current State & Opportunity:**
- Transitioning from **V1 to V2** - you're at the ground floor!
- Team is seeking to **standardize on the best architectural 'flavor'**
- Need for **testing workflows and scripts** for production readiness
- Call for team members to contribute to development

**Your Role:** Jason specifically invited interested team members to reach out to build these assets - this workspace positions you perfectly to contribute!

## **Gen AI OPS Overlap** (Secondary but Connected)

**What It Covers:**
- **Lifecycle management** for generative AI applications
- **Infrastructure as code** and operational best practices
- **Accelerator repository** with practical templates for partners
- Hands-on labs translating technical concepts to actionable skills

**The Connection:**
- Landing Zones provide the **foundation infrastructure**
- Gen AI OPS covers **what happens after deployment**: monitoring, scaling, lifecycle management, operational excellence
- Your architecture diagrams already show this overlap (Container Apps, microservices, monitoring)

## **Program Context**

**Three-Step Journey:**
1. **Business Discovery** - AI Discovery Cards workshops
2. **Landing Zones** ← Your focus
3. **Gen AI Factory/OPS** - Ongoing operations

**Target:** Empower partners to deliver AI transformation offers to customers with production-ready workloads

This positions your workspace perfectly for contributing to the Landing Zones initiative while keeping Gen AI OPS considerations in mind.
