# Quick Start Guide - Contributing to AI Landing Zones

This guide helps you get started quickly with contributing to the AI Landing Zones initiative.

## 🎯 Your Focus Areas

1. **Primary**: AI Landing Zones - Reference architectures and infrastructure
2. **Secondary**: Gen AI OPS integration - Operational concerns and Day-2 operations

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

### Week 1-2: Architecture & Documentation
1. **Review Official Resources**
   - [Azure AI Landing Zones repo](https://github.com/Azure/AI-Landing-Zones)

   - Write step-by-step guide
   - Develop hands-on exercises

2. **Test Deployment Scripts**
   - Validate Bicep templates
   - Test in clean environment
   - Document gotchas and prerequisites

### Week 5+: Templates & Pilot
1. **Create Reusable Templates**
   - Modular IaC components
   - Configuration examples
   - Deployment validation scripts

2. **Run Pilot Workshop**
   - Deliver to 1-2 partner groups
   - Gather feedback
   - Iterate on content
